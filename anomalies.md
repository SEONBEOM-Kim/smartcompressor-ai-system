  Comprehensive Report: Anomalies Dashboard Component and Its Integration with Sidebar

  1. Overview of the Anomalies Dashboard Component

  The anomalies dashboard component provides a comprehensive view of system anomalies, consisting of 5 main HTML
  files:

   1. `today-briefing.html`: High-level summary of the day's anomalies
   2. `anomaly-trend.html`: Trend charts showing anomaly patterns over time
   3. `threat-summary-card.html`: Summary card with chart visualization
   4. `threat-details-card.html`: Detailed tabular view of recent anomalies
   5. `anomaly-feed.html`: Detailed list of anomalies with filtering, grouping, and expansion capabilities

  2. Technical Implementation

  The functionality is powered by multiple JavaScript files:

   - `anomaly-chart.js`: Manages Chart.js visualization of anomaly trends
   - `ui.js`: Contains rendering functions like renderAnomalyFeed()
   - `main.js`: Entry point that initializes dashboard with data
   - `dashboard.js`: Main dashboard manager with data loading and refresh
   - `section-manager.js`: Handles navigation between dashboard sections

  3. Sidebar Integration and Navigation

  The sidebar and anomalies component are tightly integrated through several mechanisms:

  3.1 Navigation Link
   - The sidebar contains a dedicated "이상 징후" (Anomalies) link with ID anomalies-link
   - This link has a click handler that calls loadAnomaliesDetailContent() or redirects to /anomalies-detail

  3.2 Navigation Handler Function
   - The loadAnomaliesDetailContent() function in dashboard.html dynamically replaces the main content with
     anomalies-specific components
   - It loads the individual HTML components from the anomalies directory:
     - today-briefing.html
     - anomaly-trend.html
     - anomaly-feed.html

  3.3 Active State Management
   - When the anomalies link is clicked, the function updates the active state in the sidebar to highlight the
     selected item
   - It removes the 'active' class from all navigation links and adds it to the anomalies link

  4. User Interaction Flow

   1. User clicks "이상 징후" in the sidebar
   2. `loadAnomaliesDetailContent()` function is triggered
   3. Main content area is replaced with anomalies-specific layout
   4. Component loading - Each subcomponent from the anomalies directory is loaded via AJAX
   5. Chart initialization - Anomaly trend charts and mini charts are created
   6. Event handlers are set up for additional functionality like grouping and detailed views

  5. Data Flow and Updates

   - The system uses dummy data in the current implementation, but is structured to work with API calls
   - Anomaly data is rendered using the renderAnomalyFeed() function in ui.js
   - Charts are updated dynamically when new data is received
   - The system includes auto-refresh capabilities

  6. Relationship Analysis

  The sidebar serves as the primary navigation hub that allows users to switch between different dashboard sections,
  including the anomalies component. The relationship is:

   - Hierarchical: Sidebar provides top-level navigation, anomalies component provides detailed views
   - Dynamic: Clicking the anomalies link dynamically loads the component content without page refresh
   - Stateful: The active state in the sidebar reflects the current view
   - Functional: Each section has its own JavaScript logic but shares common data structures

  7. User Experience

  The integration provides a seamless experience where users can:
   - Navigate to the anomalies section from anywhere in the dashboard
   - View high-level overviews and drill down into detailed anomaly feeds
   - Use filtering and grouping capabilities to analyze anomalies
   - Access real-time charts and detailed information about each anomaly
   - Take actions on individual anomalies directly from the feed

  This architecture creates a cohesive system where the sidebar serves as the navigation backbone and the anomalies
  component provides specialized functionality for monitoring and managing system anomalies.
