# Signalcraft Development Progress

## Date: October 12, 2025

### Completed: Frontend Modularization

#### Overview
Successfully completed the modularization of the landing page (index.html) as outlined in the sw.md document.

#### Tasks Completed

1. **Created directory structure**: `static/js/landing/`
2. **Created external JavaScript files**:
   - `static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js` - Contains the `IntegratedAIDiagnosis` class with all its methods
   - `static/js/landing/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for smooth scrolling and plan selection
3. **Created external CSS file**: `static/css/landing.css` containing all the CSS styles from the original index.html
4. **Updated index.html**:
   - Removed all inline CSS and replaced with a link to `/static/css/landing.css`
   - Removed all inline JavaScript and replaced with links to external files:
     - `/static/js/landing/utils.js`
     - `/static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js`

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced index.html size**: The main HTML file is now much cleaner and more maintainable
- **Better organization**: JavaScript and CSS are now in dedicated files following proper separation of concerns
- **Improved maintainability**: Each component is in its own file, making it easier to update and debug
- **Reusability**: The JavaScript modules can now be reused in other parts of the application if needed
- **Performance**: Browsers can cache external CSS and JS files, potentially improving load times on subsequent visits

#### Files Created/Modified

1. `static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js` - Contains the AI diagnosis functionality
2. `static/js/landing/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for scrolling and plan selection
3. `static/css/landing.css` - Contains all the original CSS styles
4. `static/index.html` - Updated to reference external CSS and JS files

#### Verification
All functionality remains intact after modularization. The landing page works exactly as before but with a much cleaner, more maintainable code structure.

### Completed: App.js Modularization

#### Overview
Successfully completed the modularization of the main `app.js` file as outlined in the updated sw.md document.

#### Tasks Completed

1. **Created directory structure**: `static/js/auth/` and `static/js/ui/`
2. **Created authentication modules**:
   - `static/js/auth/auth-manager.js` - Handles authentication logic (login, logout, status management)
   - `static/js/auth/kakao-oauth.js` - Handles Kakao OAuth functionality
3. **Created UI modules**:
   - `static/js/ui/navbar-renderer.js` - Manages navigation UI and user interface rendering
   - `static/js/ui/modal-manager.js` - Handles modal dialogs (login, registration)
4. **Simplified main `app.js`**:
   - Reduced from ~800+ lines to ~100 lines focused on initialization
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing HTML files
5. **Updated HTML files** to reference the new module files:
   - `static/index.html`
   - `templates/index.html`
   - `templates/marketing_landing_page.html`

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced app.js size**: Main app.js file is significantly smaller and focused only on initialization
- **Better organization**: Specific functionality is now organized into dedicated modules
- **Improved maintainability**: Each component is in its own file, making it easier to update and debug
- **Enhanced reusability**: Modules can be more easily reused across different pages
- **Maintained compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with backward compatibility

#### Files Created/Modified

1. `static/js/auth/auth-manager.js` - Authentication management
2. `static/js/auth/kakao-oauth.js` - Kakao authentication
3. `static/js/ui/navbar-renderer.js` - Navigation rendering
4. `static/js/ui/modal-manager.js` - Modal management
5. `static/app.js` - Simplified entry point
6. Updated HTML files to reference new modules

#### Verification
All functionality remains intact after modularization. The application works exactly as before but with a much cleaner, more maintainable code structure.
