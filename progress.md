### Completed: Frontend Modularization

#### Overview
Successfully completed the modularization of the landing page (index.html) as outlined in the sw.md document.

#### Tasks Completed

1. **Created directory structure**: `static/js/landing/`
2. **Created external JavaScript files**:
   - `static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js` - Contains the `IntegratedAIDiagnosis` class with all its methods
   - `static/js/landing/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for smooth scrolling and plan selection
3. **Created external CSS file**: `static/css/landing.css` containing all the CSS styles from the original index.html
4. **Updated index.html**:
   - Removed all inline CSS and replaced with a link to `/static/css/landing.css`
   - Removed all inline JavaScript and replaced with links to external files:
     - `/static/js/landing/utils.js`
     - `/static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js`

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Reduced index.html size**: The main HTML file is now much cleaner and more maintainable
- **Better organization**: JavaScript and CSS are now in dedicated files following proper separation of concerns
- **Improved maintainability**: Each component is in its own file, making it easier to update and debug
- **Reusability**: The JavaScript modules can now be reused in other parts of the application if needed
- **Performance**: Browsers can cache external CSS and JS files, potentially improving load times on subsequent visits

#### Files Created/Modified

1. `static/js/landing/ai-diagnosis.js` - Contains the AI diagnosis functionality
2. `static/js/landing/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for scrolling and plan selection
3. `static/css/landing.css` - Contains all the original CSS styles
4. `static/index.html` - Updated to reference external CSS and JS files

#### Verification
All functionality remains intact after modularization. The landing page works exactly as before but with a much cleaner, more maintainable code structure.
